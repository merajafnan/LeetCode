# Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
# For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:
# https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_1_1.png
# Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
# Output: Intersected at '8'
# Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
# From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.

        l1,r1 = headA,headB

            r1 = r1.next if r1 else headA
        return l1
